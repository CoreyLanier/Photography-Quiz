# Photography Quiz

## Description

I used basic html and CSS in order to create the outline an visuals for the site. I then used JSS to create an array of objects that contain the questions for the quiz. I then used a for loop to dynamically go through each of the questions and then add it to the page. I also added a timer and score counter. When you get a question right you get an addition 5 seconds to the timer. If you get it wrong you get 5 seconds taken away. Then wehen you come to the last question it tells you your score and you are able to store that score in local memory for retrievel on the next time you sign in.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
